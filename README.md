# EDA-India--Trade-Data




India is one of the fastest developing nations of the world and trade between nations is the major component of any developing nation. This dataset includes the trade data for India for commodities in the HS2 basket.





The dataset consists of trade values for export and import of commodities in million US$. The dataset is tidy and each row consists of a single observation.







A few questions that can be answered using this dataset are
1. What did India export the most in any given year?
2. Which commodity forms a major chunk of trade? Does it conform to theories of international trade? 
3. How has the trade between India and any given country grown over time?
A visualization of this dataset would be a great way to explore more such questions.
